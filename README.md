# CSci-135

This repository includes all the codes I used in my CSci 135 case study. All files are experimental
as the course explicitly focuses on instruction of Python and its application to Meteorology.
I am simply uploading them here for backup and archive purposes.

p.s. the codes are messy and make no sense now that I re-read them xd
